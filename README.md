## Description

`utl` is a collection of utilities for Go projects.

I found myself constantly copy and pasting util functions from one project to another, and often make slight modifications to fit the specific needs of each project. This resulted in having many copies of the same code, scattered across various projects, and it was becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of which function was the most up-to-date.

To avoid duplication and simplify maintenance, I thought it would be a good idea to centralize them in a separate package, write decent documentation and tests, and use the package as a dependency across multiple projects.

> The package is still a work in progress, and I'm adding new functions and structs as I need them.

## Installation
